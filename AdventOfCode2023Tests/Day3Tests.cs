    The engine schematic (your puzzle input) consists of a visual 
    representation of the engine. There are lots of numbers and symbols 
    you don't really understand, but apparently 

    any number adjacent to a symbol, even diagonally, is a "part number" 

    and should be included in your sum. (Periods (.) do not count as a 
    symbol.)

    In this schematic, 
- two numbers not part numbers (not adjacent to a symbol): 114 (top right) and 58 (middle right)
- rest is adjacent to a symbol and so is a part number; their sum is 4361.

Q: What is the sum of all part numbers? */
